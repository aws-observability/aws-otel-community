## Welcome to the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry Community!

If you’re an open source observability user or contributor, we invite you to get involved. You can contribute in the following ways:

* Ask a question by filing an [issue](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-community/issues).
* File a bug by filing a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-community/pulls).
* Contribute an enhancement or a feature which you need and maintainers will be happy to code review. You can open an issue to discuss the design of your proposed enhancement and then file a PR.
* If you’re just getting started, we welcome you to get started with issues tagged as “good first issue”. Please feel free to join the [CNCF OpenTelemetry Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/CJFCJHG4Q) to ask maintainers and other developers any questions you may have for e.g, [#opentelemetry](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/CJFCJHG4Q) channel for more interactions about the project. If you are new, you can create a CNCF Slack account [here](http://slack.cncf.io/).
* Join the awesome upstream OpenTelemetry project [community](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community). Participate in the OpenTelemetry [SIG meetings](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community#calendar) where observability experts meet and discuss the OpenTelemetry specification and implementation of observability components. And the code is open source - so contribute to OpenTelemetry!
